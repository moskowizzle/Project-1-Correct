#To Do List Project (Project #1)
-----------------

This app allows you to create any number of to do lists, create items within the lists and add a description for each item, if you wish (optional). You can swipe to delete either lists or items, and you can also edit the items within the list or the description by heading to the description page. If you enter an invalid list or item (blank entry), the placeholder will change to a message prompting the user to enter a list/item depending on which screen they're on.
